# Project name : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Features and MSRP Dataset

## Project Description

This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing various features of cars and their corresponding Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that could explain the variations in car prices and to identify key factors that influence the MSRP.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Understand the dataset and its structure.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Analyze the data to discover patterns and relationships between car features and MSRP.
- Identify key factors that influence car pricing.
- Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features for different car models:

- **Make:** Manufacturer or brand of the car.
- **Model:** Specific model of the car.
- **Year:** Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Engine Fuel Type:** Type of fuel used by the engine (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric).
- **Horsepower:** Power output of the car's engine.
- **Transmission Type:** Type of transmission system (e.g., automatic, manual).
- **Drive Type:** Drivetrain layout (e.g., front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).
- **Vehicle Size:** Classification of the car's size (e.g., compact, midsize).
- **Vehicle Style:** Body style of the car (e.g., sedan, SUV).
- **Highway MPG:** Fuel efficiency on highways, measured in miles per gallon.
- **City MPG:** Fuel efficiency in city driving, measured in miles per gallon.
- **MSRP:** Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.

## Key Tasks

### 1. Data Understanding
- Examine the structure, data types, and summary statistics of the dataset.
- Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, or errors.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Filter out irrelevant or redundant data.
- Handle outliers and ensure that all numerical features are correctly formatted.
- Correct data entry errors and handle categorical data appropriately.

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Analyze the distribution of individual features.
- Visualize distributions using histograms, boxplots, and density plots.

### 4. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
- Explore relationships between different features and MSRP.
- Use scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.
- Examine how categorical variables influence MSRP using boxplots and group statistics.

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Create new features to enhance the understanding of factors affecting MSRP.
- Encode categorical variables for further analysis or modeling.

### 6. Visualization and Insights
- Use data visualization to communicate findings.
- Identify the most influential features on MSRP and suggest reasons for trends.

### 7. Documentation and Reporting
- Document the entire EDA process.
- Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing key insights and findings.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Insightful Visualizations:** Graphs and charts that reveal trends, correlations, and outliers.
- **Key Insights:** A clear understanding of the factors that most significantly impact car prices.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Suggestions for car manufacturers, marketers, or dealerships based on the findings.
- **Prepared Dataset:** A cleaned and processed dataset ready for further analysis or predictive modeling.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive analysis and documentation.

## Conclusion

This EDA project aims to provide valuable insights into car pricing based on features, helping stakeholders understand the factors that drive MSRP. The findings can be used for further analysis, such as predictive modeling, or to inform business strategies in the automotive industry.
